# Chrom-Dino-Bot
This script plays the Chrome Dino game using pyautogui and pytesseract

* Currently have to resize your window to place the FOV rectangle right above the running surface.
* Program can run an average of 230 points in the game. The game speeds up and time intervals between jumps become inaccurate.
* Pytesseract is currently a work in progress. It is going to be used to read the score and determine dynamically the time interval beteen jumps.
